                                Hello! My name is Adreanna or <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/digi-wulf" target="_blank">digi-wulf</a> on GitHub!
                            
                                I am a Web Developer looking to apply my skills, knowledge, and creativity to those looking to upgrade their website! 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I create every site from scratch, meaning I personally build it and do not use a site builder. However, if you have a pre-existing site or prefer features of certain site builders, I do have experience working in WordPress, Squarespace, and Wix, as well as some exposure to Canva and Webflow.
                            </p>
                            <h3 class="sub-head">History</h3>
                            <p>
                                Before I got into programming, I really enjoyed designing and creating characters and stories independently. I didn't know how to apply my creative skills, so I applied for a Game Development and Simulation degree, hoping to show people my ideas and expand on the little worlds I had created. However, when I had to take a few intro classes for Web Development, I realized how much I enjoyed it. The idea of making a website from the ground up and building and designing it as you needed was so interesting to me. This also gave me the courage to create my own site from the stories and characters I have been developing for many years. With that in mind, I quickly changed my major to Web Development while completing the Game Development and Simulation certificate.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During my college career, I also worked alongside and led teams to build the courage and confidence essential when working with clients and projects trusted to me.
                                I had a chance to help run and maintain the <a class="text-link" href="https://magnoliaparkdiadelosmuertos.com/" target="_blank">Magnolia Park Dia de los Muertos</a> site hosted on Squarespace. When I was asked to help with the site, I had no prior knowledge of how Squarespace worked. Still, I quickly adapted once I adjusted to the site's features and how it felt similar to WordPress, which I had prior experience working with from one of my classes. I maintained the site for 2 years until I decided to pursue my Bachelor's degree in Cloud Computing to better my chances of finding work.
